# K-pop;Choose One Quiz

#### Video Demo: <[video demo](https://www.example.com/my%20great%20page)>

#### Description:

This project is more like a website. People will have to login or signup. After that, there will be a quiz form which includes a few questions about a Korean boy band named BTS.

#### How did I get the idea?

I am a fan of BTS. Since I started learning programming, I've been wanting to do a project about them.
A project which I might be able to release one day in real world.
After learning more things in programming, I will polish this project.
**K-pop;Choose One Quiz** website might become a place where ARMY can come answer the quiz, get scores and hav fun!

#### How did I make it?

As I mentioned, this is a website properly. So, the project includes HTML and CSS.
I used "flask" to link the data from my HTML forms. If user entered valid email and password in signup form, whether username and password match in login form or not, are checked by Python. In ihis case, I made up two usernames and their own passwords (123456 for winnie, 111111 for logan) as I don't have a database yet. And checking how many score did the user get is also worked by Python.
